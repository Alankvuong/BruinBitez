# Bryft
Bryft is a project created for CS35L that serves as a website for UCLA students to find and give rides with other students.

# Picking Up A New Issue
When picking up a new issue to develop, ensure you create a new branch from main. Try your best to not push directly to main and do a pull request from your develop branch instead.

# Branch Naming Conventions
When creating a new branch, follow this pattern: "develop-{short name to describe task being developed}"
